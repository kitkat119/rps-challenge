# RPS Challenge

## Maker's Academy Week 3 weekend challenge

We were asked to provide a game for Makers Academy Marketing Array(MAMA) to allow them to let off some steam!

We were given the following user stories:
```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## How to download and run the app:
- git clone git@github.com:kitkat119/rps-challenge.git
- cd rps-challenge
- bundle
- rackup
- Try to get to 50 points before the computer! Good Luck!
